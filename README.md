# glotchimo's rice files

Note a few things:
1. I'm new to ricing/advanced Linux things
2. Some settings might be dependent on things I haven't thought to include (DPI/monitor settings, stuff like that)
3. The content of this repo is going to evolve over time

If you notice something that's bugged or missing, don't hesitate to let me know via an issue or message on Reddit or something.
